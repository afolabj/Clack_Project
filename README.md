In your test classes, what happens if you provide a negative value for a port
number, or a null value for a user? How do you think you can fix these issues?

If you provide a negative value for a port number or a null value for a user it will output 
a negative value and a null value. To fix these issues we can use error checking to provide 
conditions so the port number is never less than zero and check if a username is valid and 
not equal to null.
